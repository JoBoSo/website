                    <i>My first bike tour.</i> I started at my father’s house in Schomberg, Ontario and Biked to Montreal via the Waterfront Trail. I had to ride through Toronto’s suburbs—a dreary landscape—on my first day before I reached the Waterfront Trail. Suburban Southern Ontario is the worst place the be as a bicycle tourist or enthusiast of anything that money alone can’t buy. It’s almost exclusively developed and privately-owned land, roads are busy, it’s flat, and everything blends together as one massive corporate development. It’s such as sad place. I love Toronto Real, however. I like it more than any other Canadian city I’ve been in. As soon as I reached Darlington Provincial Park on Lake Ontario, everything was great aside from the $50 campsite fee.

                    You could say that The Big Money Bicycle Tour began on my second day of this tour. I rode through towns along Lake Ontario. The road through Whitby took me by beautiful old houses and the marshy landscape around Presqu’ile Provincial Park was peaceful. In Prince Edward County, I biked down a long dirt path through farmers’ fields and saw people touring orchards and having weddings or something like that. I finished my day in a conservation area near Picton. My ride toward Kingston the next morning was along a quite stretch of the Waterfront Trail. It was beautiful country, but nothing much stands out to me other than a big factory near Kingston with tall smokestacks. I stayed in a motel in Kingston. The next day, I biked past the military base and took the ferry on the edge of Kingston. Gananoque and Brockville are beautiful towns. I felt like the pace of the places I was biking through was slower than those closer to Toronto. I showed up at Crysler Park Marina in the evening to camp. It looked like a golf course. On my fifth day, I experienced the best of the Waterfront Trail. I rode by the historic sites in Upper Canada Village and crossed a series of islands connected by Long Sault Highway. I hung out by the marina in Cornwall at lunch time, then pedalled on to Glengarry Campground near Lancaster for another great night of riverfront camping. On my sixth and final day, I rode into Montreal. I arrived at an AirBnB in the city and went to three restaurants and had a drink and food at each. I took the train back to Toronto the next day.
